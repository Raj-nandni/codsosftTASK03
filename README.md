# codsosftTASK03
A Rock-Paper-Scissors game coded in Python allows users to play against the computer in this classic hand game. The program randomly selects the computer's move and compares it to the player's input, determining the winner based on the standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
